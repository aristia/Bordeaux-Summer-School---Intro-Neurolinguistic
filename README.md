# Bordeaux Summer School 2024 <br/> Project 8: Introduction to Neurolinguistic

In this project you will learn about why we bother to look at the brain to study language processing. 
Due to this endevour to understand the how language is processed *(for now, we will only focus on this!)*  and produced by the brain we have neurolinguistics.
There are several methods that are used to study the brain and one of them is electroencephalography (EEG). 
In this project, we will see how EEG is used in language processing study and how to do one of the most common analysis method that is event-related-potential (ERP). 
I will introduce you what are the common ERP components that are normally observed in neurolinguistic studies. 
To do this we will analyze data from [ERP CORE](https://erpinfo.org/erp-core) datasets that is provided by Steve J Luck lab. 
ERP CORE has several datasets, for the purpose of this project, we will use N400 datasets because N400 is a common ERP component that is normally observed in neurolinguistic studies.
